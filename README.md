Strava API Experiements
=======================

## No longer receiving security updates

Playing around with the Strava API.

So far I have made a graph that plots all of your efforts on a particular segment with the average time as well.

More information on the [Strava API](http://www.strava.com/developers).

A working example can be seen at [http://ianluckraft.co.uk/strava/](http://ianluckraft.co.uk/strava/)

I've used [SlimPHP](http://www.slimframework.com/) and [Guzzle](http://guzzle.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) for routing and HTTP requests.

The graph is made with [D3.js](http://d3js.org/).
